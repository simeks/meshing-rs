# Dual contouring / Marching cubes

Playground for generating meshes from isosurfaces in Rust. Rough implementations of marching cubes and dual contouring ([Dual Contouring of Hermite Data](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~jwarren/papers/dualcontour.pdf)).

Uses bevy for simple viewer:
* [tab] toggles dual contouring (red) / marching cubes (green)
* [1] toggles wireframe.
